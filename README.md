[Apple and Google release test version of coronavirus tracing software](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/29/apple-and-google-release-test-version-of-coronavirus-tracing-software.html).

## Opinion
I think this article is interesting for a couple reasons. For one, I think it's cool to see in what way major companies such as Google and Apple are deciding to contribute to the fight against the pandemic. Apparently they teamed up together, which is awesome. Since a large majority of people have Google and Apple phones, the products they've developed will be sure to reach this large majority very easily. I also think the article is interesting simply because it discusses topics that we've covered very recently in class, such as centralized servers.
